### Weather

SASIE uses [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) to obtain weather data to display on the dashboard, in order for this to work a free API Key is required.

#### Obtaining OpenWeather API Key

1. Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. After signing in, go to your [API keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) page
3. Copy your API key (or generate a new one)
4. In the application settings, paste your API key in the "Weather API Key" field

#### Setting Location

OpenWeather requires the Suburb and Country in the following format: `Suburb,au` e.g. `Melbourne,au`

[!IMPORTANT]
The free tier has a limit of 60 calls/minute, which is more than sufficient for this application.

### Events

You can add your own events, ensuring the event display is enabled in settings.

To add custom events, from the File Menu select Events.

Click Add New Event and enter the event details.
